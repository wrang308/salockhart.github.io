This is one of the first android applications I made as a learning project to gain knowledge in app development.
It is a simple three in a row game with images of my beloved little brother.

### App

It's a simple application made in android studio as a learning project and a joke with my brother. It got two windows, one for the game and one settings window where you can choose your favorite David image. I'm planning to add even more images in the future ;)
The game also got two different game modes one where you fill the board and one where you have three pieces and move until someone wins.
