In this exercise we made a Single Page Application. it consists of a page with
multiple applications that you can open and close. Currently an quiz game exists,
a chat application and an analog clock.

### Site

This site works like one single page, all elements in the page are added
dynamically. All the applications work as standalone applications and could be
used for other sites. The structure for more draggable applications exists and
they could easily be added.
