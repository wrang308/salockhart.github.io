This is an app I made for a summer camp with various nice information about the camp. It got a countdown until the camp, a list of games usually played during the camp and more
nice stuff.

### App

It's started by me making a simple countdown application for I camp that I've went to. Then I added some small features and improved on the app. I added features that
can be useful for everyone that is going to the camp. One of the the bigger ones is a list of games that is usually played during the camp with description and this feature can probably be used a lot outside the camp to.
In short it's a project that I work on for fun that I hope can bring some joy for the ones in the camp and maybe someone else outside the camp. Some things was tedious but like writing the description for all the games but I could learn things from that too.
